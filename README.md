# 📘 Algorithms-I

An open-source walkthrough of classic algorithmic techniques, geared for learners exploring data structures, sorting, recursion, and graph theory. This repository follows a conceptual-first, code-second approach—with intuitive breakdowns and edge case awareness.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Searching algorithms (binary search, interpolation search)
- Sorting (merge sort, quicksort, heap sort)
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies
- Dynamic programming fundamentals
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s)
- Union-find and disjoint-set operations

## 🧪 How to Use
Each algorithm includes:
- ✅ A conceptual explanation
- 🧠 Pseudocode and annotated source code (Python/Java)
- 🧪 Test cases and sample inputs
- 📎 Edge case notes and performance considerations

Browse the folders by topic. Each module is self-contained with a README and examples.
